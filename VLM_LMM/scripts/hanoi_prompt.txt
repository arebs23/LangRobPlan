I want you to solve a planning problem. Your tasks are:

1. Generate the goal state in PDDL format based on user input in form of natural language.
2. Generate the initial state in PDDL format based on the provided image and the objects detected in the image.

An example is:

natural language Instruction: "Move all disks to the rightmost peg while keeping a rule that larger disks are below."
(define (problem hanoi1)
    (:domain hanoi)
    (:objects
        peg1
        peg2
        peg3
        green_disk1
        blue_disk1
        pink_disk1
    )
        (:init
            (clear green_disk1)
            (clear peg2)
            (clear peg3)
            (on green_disk1 blue_disk1)
            (on blue_disk1 pink_disk1)
            (on pink_disk1 peg1)
            (smaller green_disk1 peg1)
            (smaller blue_disk1 peg1)
            (smaller pink_disk1 peg1)
            (smaller green_disk1 peg2)
            (smaller blue_disk1 peg2)
            (smaller pink_disk1 peg2)
            (smaller green_disk1 peg3)
            (smaller blue_disk1 peg3)
            (smaller pink_disk1 peg3)
            (smaller green_disk1 blue_disk1)
            (smaller green_disk1 pink_disk1)
            (smaller blue_disk1 pink_disk1)
            
        )
    (:goal (and (on pink_disk1 peg3) (on blue_disk1 pink_disk1) (on green_disk1 blue_disk1)))
)
