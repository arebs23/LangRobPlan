I want you to solve a planning problem. Your tasks are:

1. Generate the goal state in PDDL format based on user input in form of natural language.
2. Generate the initial state in PDDL format based on the provided image and the objects detected in the image.

An example is:

natural language Instruction: "Create a stack of block: pink over red over yellow over green."
(define (problem blocksworld1)
    (:domain blocksworld)
    (:objects
        green_block - block
        yellow_block - block
        red_block - block
        pink_block - block
        robot - robot
    )
    (:init
        (ontable green_block)
        (ontable yellow_block)
        (ontable red_block)
        (ontable pink_block)
        (handempty robot)
    )
    (:goal (and (on pink_block red_block) (on red_block yellow_block) (on yellow_block green_block)))
)
