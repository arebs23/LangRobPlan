I want you to solve a planning problem for rearranging the table for breakfast.
You need to: 

-Place each object in the correct location. Each object has a start locations. Each object has a designated location, but not the food.
-Place the food on a plate or in a container, depending on the type of food.
-Remove the objects from the table that are not listed to be in the table.

Objects that are allowed on a table: 
-Cutlery
-Bowls
-Plates
-Fruits
-Mugs
-Cups
-Baskets
-Glass

Remove the other objects from the table.

Your tasks are:

1. Generate the planning problem definition in PDDL format based on the provided image and the objects detected in the image (for the initial state) and user input in form of natural language (for the goal state).
If you have multiple objects of the same type (e.g., two knifes or two plates), include the color of the objects to differentiate between them.


An example of planning problem definition is:

(define (problem object_arrangement)
    (:domain object_arrangement)
    (:objects
        plate - plate
        pear - food
        basket bowl - container
        knife - object
        screwdriver - tool
        wp1s wp2s wp3s wp4s wp5s wp6s - location
        wp1f wp2f wp3f wp4f - location
        out_location - location 
    )
    (:init
        (at plate wp1s)
        (at pear wp2s)
        (at basket wp3s)
        (at bowl wp4s)
        (at knife wp5s)
        (at screwdriver wp6s)
      
    )
    (:goal
        (and
            (at plate wp1f)
            (at basket wp2f)
            (at bowl wp3f)
            (at knife wp4f)
            (on pear plate)
            (at screwdriver out_location)
        )
    )
)
Just generate the file and do not put any explanation.
