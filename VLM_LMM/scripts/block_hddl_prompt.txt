I want you to solve a planning problem. Your tasks are:

1. Generate the goal state in HDDL format(htn) based on user input in form of natural language.
2. Generate the initial state in HDDL format based on the provided image and the objects detected in the image.

An example is:

natural language Instruction: "Create a stack of block: pink over red over yellow over green."
(define
	(problem pfile01)
	(:domain  domain_htn)
      (:objects
        green_block - block
        yellow_block - block
        red_block - block
        pink_block - block
        robot - robot
      )
	(:htn
		:parameters ()
		:subtasks (and
		 (task0 (stack_item yellow_block green_block))
         (task1 (stack_item red_block yellow_block))
          (task2 (stack_item pink_block red_block))
		)
		:ordering (and
		    (< task1 task0)
                (< task2 task1)
		)
	)
	  (:init
        (ontable green_block)
        (ontable yellow_block)
        (ontable red_block)
        (ontable pink_block)
    )
)
