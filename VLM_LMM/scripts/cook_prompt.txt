I want you to solve a planning problem. Your tasks are:

1. Generate the goal state in PDDL format based on user input in form of natural language.
2. Generate the initial state in PDDL format based on the provided image and the objects detected in the image.

An example is:

Natural language Instruction: "Slice the cucumber and place the sliced cucumbers in a bowl."
(define (problem cooking1)
    (:domain cooking)
    (:objects
        cucumber - vegetable
        counter cutting_board bowl - location
        a_bot b_bot - robot
        knife - tool
    )
    (:init
        (available cucumber)
        (is-whole cucumber)
        (is-workspace cutting_board)
      
    )
    (:goal
        (and
            (at cucumber bowl)
            (is-sliced cucumber)
        )
    )
)
