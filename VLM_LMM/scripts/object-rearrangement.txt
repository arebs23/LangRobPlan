I want you to solve a planning problem. Your tasks are:

1. Generate the goal state in PDDL format based on user input in form of natural language.
2. Generate the initial state in PDDL format based on the provided image and the objects detected in the image.
3. Generate the initial and final position values of the objects in pixel coordinates.
An example is:

natural language Instruction: "Rearrange the table for breakfast and give the final pose of the objects."
(define (problem breakfast)
    (:domain breakfast)
    (:objects
        knife - tool
        apple - fruit
        bowl  - tool
        plate - tool
        robot - robot
        w1_s w2_s w3_s w4_s w1_f w2_f w3_f  - location
    )
    (:init
        (at knife w1_s)
        (at pear w2_s)
        (ontable pear)
        (at bowl w3_s)
        (at plate w4_s)
        (free robot)
      
    )
    (:goal
        (and
            (at knife w1_f)
             (at bowl w2_f)
              (at plate w3_f)
            (in pear plate)
           
        )
    )
)
