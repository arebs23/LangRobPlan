The image shows a peg puzzle with rings stacked on the leftmost peg. From top to bottom, the order is as follows:

1. Purple ring
2. Blue ring
3. Orange ring
4. Red ring

Now, let's move all disks to the rightmost peg while keeping the rule that larger disks are below. 

### Initial Ordering:
```
peg1: red_ring orange_ring blue_ring purple_ring
peg2: none
peg3: none
```

In PDDL format:

```lisp
(define (problem hanoi1)
    (:domain hanoi)
    (:objects
        peg1 peg2 peg3
        red_ring orange_ring blue_ring purple_ring
    )
    (:init
        (clear purple_ring)
        (clear peg2)
        (clear peg3)
        (on purple_ring blue_ring)
        (on blue_ring orange_ring)
        (on orange_ring red_ring)
        (on red_ring peg1)
    )
    (:goal (and 
        (on red_ring peg3) 
        (on orange_ring red_ring) 
        (on blue_ring orange_ring) 
        (on purple_ring blue_ring)
    ))
)
```

This PDDL defines the initial configuration of rings on peg1 and specifies the goal where all rings are transferred in the correct order to peg3.
